# Hey There! I'm Arihant Sharma 🐱  
I'm a fullstack developer **highly** interested in the field of ML and AI. I'm a sucker for always trying to upskill my code and my projects!
I enjoy creating apps using new technologies I come across, and i always look for ways to improve the projects i'm working on.

## Tech Stack :octocat:  
- I am always looking to learn, so i don't mind switching frameworks for projects but i mostly use Next, Typescript, Django, Postgre and Shadcdn.
- Learning PyTorch (work in progress) 🐈‍⬛
